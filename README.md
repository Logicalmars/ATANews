Install
=======

This is a Yeoman web app, so you need to install Grunt and Bower before hand. 

Then, you can simply clone this repo, and run `bower install`. 

Since I'm using a darker theme of boostrap, you need to overwrite `../bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css` with `styles/dark_bootstrap.css`.

Finally, run `grunt serve` and the website is ready to go.

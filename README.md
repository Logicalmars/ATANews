Install
=======

This is a Yeoman web app, so you need to install Grunt and Bower before hand. Just follow the [link](http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html) and it should be as simple as `npm install -g yo`.

Then, you can simply clone this repo, and run `bower install`, `grunt bowerInstall`.

Since I'm using a darker theme of boostrap, you need to overwrite `../bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css` with `styles/dark_bootstrap.css`.

Finally, run `grunt serve` and the website is ready to go.
